# 📢 MESSAGE TO AGENT

You are working on **{{PROJECT_NAME}}**. This file contains everything you need.

**Golden Rules:**
1. 🔒 **Don't change technologies** - They're locked
2. 📖 **Read reports first** - Before any fix
3. 📝 **Update this file** - After every change
4. ❓ **Ask before deleting** - Always
5. 🎯 **One file = One place** - No duplicates

**Remember:**
> The user doesn't read code. They rely on you and Debug Toolkit.
> Be honest - if it didn't work, say it didn't work.
